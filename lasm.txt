LINKASM.COM
01/07/80	by Ward Christensen

OVERVIEW:
	LINKASM is based on CP/M assembler 1.0, and is
compatible with 1.0, 1.3, and 1.4 assemblers.  (2.0? Dunno.)
		----------------
LINKASM is a rewrite of CP/M 1.0 ASM.COM, incorporating:

*	A new pseudo-op code, LINK.
*	Smaller .COM file size (6K vs 8K).
*	Faster execution via larger ASM, HEX, and PRN buffers
*	Corrections to properly handle lower case DB values.
*	Prints the number of source lines read
*	Produces a symbol table for use under SID

	The LINK pseudo-op allows a file to "chain" to the 
next .ASM file, thereby allowing very large source files to
be processed without having to PIP them together.

RESTRICTIONS:
	All the linked .ASM files must be on the same disk.
	Nested IFs are not handled (ASM.COM didn't either)
Note that you can use IF to conditionally link to the next
module:

	IF	CLOCK
	LINK	CLOCKRTN
	ENDIF
;
	IF	NOT CLOCK
	LINK	OTHERRTN
	ENDIF

	For example, if CLOCK is true, then LINK CLOCKRTN
(i.e. CLOCKRTN.ASM) will take place, and the assembler
will never see the ENDIF.  This is not a problem as the
next encountered IF will be handled properly.
		----------------
USAGE:
	LINKASM is totally compatible with ASM.COM, and
you may therefore replace ASM.  Its performance will be
slightly better than ASM.COM, and it takes less space on
disk (6K vs 8K).
	Execute it just like ASM.COM, i.e. 
	
	LINKASM name.p1p2p3

where:	p1 is the .ASM file disk (A, B, ...)
	p2 is the .HEX file disk (A, B, ... or Z for none)
	p3 is the .PRN file disk (A, B, ... or Z for none,
		or X for the console)

	The default is the logged in disk for all 3.

	If you wish to write a symbol table file, follow
the command line with the disk to be written to (A, B, ...)
then a colon.  For example, to assemble FOO from the A:
disk, put the .HEX on the A: disk, send the .SYM file to
B:, and the listing to the console:

	LINKASM FOO.AAX B:

	To assemble it doing everything on the A: disk
(assuming A: is the logged in disk):

	LINKASM FOO A:

	The ":" must be specified after the .SYM disk.  The 
.SYM file is "partially" sorted, i.e. all Axxxx then all Bxxxx
etc.  SID fully scans the symbol table anyway, so sorting
it is not necessary, so I did this quick sort hack just to
make it eaiser for YOU to find a symbol.
		----------------
	The LINK pseudo ops take a single operand: the name
of an .ASM file to be processed next.  For example:
----------------
A:TEST1.ASM:

	ORG	100H
	LXI	H,MSG
	MVI	C,9
	CALL	BDOS
	RET
	LINK	TEST2
----------------
A:TEST2.ASM:

MSG	DB	'Linked'
BDOS	EQU	5
----------------
	Then assemble it:

A>LINKASM TEST1.AZX
LINKASM AS OF 7/13/79


 0100			ORG	100H
 0100 210901		LXI     H,MSG
 0103 0E09		MVI	C,9
 0105 CD0500		CALL    BDOS
 0108 C9		RET
                        LINK	TEST2
 0109 4C696E6B65MSG     DB	'Linked'
 0005 =		BDOS	EQU	5
010F
000H use factor
8 input lines read
End of assembly

		----------------
	I will make one apology for LINKASM - I neglected
to put in an error message saying the name of the missing
file, if you should accidentally LINK to a non-existant file. 
It just says the source file is not present.
	If necessary, you can find the name which was
being searched for.  It's in memory at 186H.  If you have
a PROM monitor, you can examine it.  If not, do the following
BEFORE executing any more COM programs following the LINKASM:

	SAVE 1 BADNAME.COM	Save 100-1ff to disk     
	DDT BADNAME.COM		Bring in under DDT (or SID)
	D186,190		Dump the name
	^C			Reboot (some people use G0)
	ERA BADNAME.COM		ERA the temporary file.

Sorry for that hack, but I thought it better to put LINKASM
in the CP/M UG with that problem, rather than holding it
back "trying to make it perfect".
		----------------
I have not encountered any problems using LINKASM as my
main assembler for about the last 6 months.  Among other
things, I use it to assemble CBBS.ASM which, with its 14
or so LINKed files, is over 6000 lines.  It takes about 5 1/2
minutes, as I recall (HEX and SYM, no PRN).
