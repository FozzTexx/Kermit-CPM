;	All the SET xxx and status routines now in CPSCOM.ASM as CPSMIT.ASM
;	was getting too big.
;
; revision history:
;
;edit 30, 29-Mar-1991 by MF. When looking up a TAKE-file in a TAKE command
;	and the file is not found, complain if it's not the first TAKE of
;	the current program execution (the automatic TAKE of KERMIT.INI)
;edit 29, 25-Mar-1991 by MF. Add STAY command as a synonym for SET NO-EXIT
;	command per Martin J. Carter of Nottingham University in the U.K.
;edit 28, 21-Mar-1991 by MF. Modify code after "inp2a" in INPUT command
;	so a ^C will halt TAKE-file processing
;edit 27, 27-Feb-1991 by MF. Add QUIT as a synonym for EXIT per code of
;	Dr. Martin J. Carter of Nottingham University, U.K. Recognizing QUIT
;	helps those who forget they're not in MS-Kermit, C-Kermit,
;	Kermit-32 etc. Also add commands so that CONNECT, RECEIVE and SEND may
;	be abbreviated to C,  R and S, respectively.
;edit 26, 5-Nov-1990 by MF.  Cosmetic changes to main HELP messages for
;	COPY and RENAME commands.
;edit 25, 1-Nov-1990 by MF.  Made the following command-name changes in the
;	interest of uniformity of nomenclature (per suggestions of FDC):
;	FCOPY to COPY, FRENAME to RENAME and STRING to OUTPUT.
;	This means we'll have to type "CO" for CONNECT and "REC" for 
;	RECEIVE but with REMOTE now with us we have to do the latter anyway.
;edit 24, 18-Sep-1990 by MF.  Implemented FRENAME command to rename a
;	CP/M file.
;edit 23, 9-Sep-1990 by MF.  Implemented commands to be sent to a
;	remote Kermit Server (Remote commands).
;	Implemented setting of packet sizes for RECEIVE and SEND.
;	Put DIRECTORY/STRING help texts in proper alphabetical position.
; edit 22, July 6th, 1987 by OBSchou.  Added a dummy Commandline to be
;	loaded for debugging purposes as DDT destroys any command line at 80H
;	Also fixed a bug or two...
;
; edit 21, April 8th, 1987.
;	Various bits, including more SET SENDRECEIVE options, and make 
;	PADDING and PADCHAR valid options.  Have I wasted my time, or 
;	there still systems that use padding??  Fixed a bug in the INPUT
;	command so we know how many characters there are to check for. Also
;	hived off the SET commands to make a new file, CPSCOM.ASM thereby
;	reducing the size of CPSMIT.ASM.  Also rename COPY command to FCOPY
;	hence retaining a single C to imply connect.
;
; edit 20, March 30, 1987 by OBSchou.  
;	added code for no exit to CPM if a command tail is done (optional)
;	by the SET NO-EXIT command.  Added bits for SET AUTORECEIVE to enable 
;	or inhibit automatic receive of several files (if something is coming 
;	along from the remote side, do a receive. Toss first packet away.)  
;	This is first step to SERVER???
;	Also added back the INPUT command.
;
; edit 19, March 16, 1987.  Moved the code to check for and execute 
;	command tails (See Richard Russells submission below).  
;	Added flags to exit to CP/M after executing a command tail.  
;	The KERMIT.INI file is taken before the command tail is issued.
;
; edit 18, March 11, 1987 by OBSchou.
;	Added in code for TYPE <file> and PRINT <file>.  Hope to add COPY 
;	later on.  Also added in code submitted by Richard Russel, to accept
;	a command tail on entry to kermit (eg KERMIT CONNECT).  This facility
;	if used, will replace the automatic TAKE function on loading Kermit.
;	Unfortunately, you will not be dropped back to CP/M after the command
;	In the future, it may be possible to either accept several commands
;	on the command tail, and possibly accept the automatic TAKE facility
;	as well.  Low on my list of things to do.
;
; edit 17, January 28, 1987 by OBSchou for DJ Roberts of Leicester
;	Also added a couple of fixes [obs]
;
; 	DJR  January 1987  David J. Roberts.
;          USER made a SET option
;          STATUS output placed in alphabetical order
;          Report DEBUG mode and default disk 
;          Name of LOG file on SHOW/STATUS display
;
;
; edit 16 December 1st, OBSchou.  Fixed bug in that if the overlay is not in
;	place or correct then prtstr is not called to print the error message
;	(As prtstr has been moved out of the system independent code)
;
; edit 15 November 10, 1986 by OBSchou.  Re-inserted Pause and Break 
;       commands for release.
;
; edit 14 August 29, 1986.  Removed PAUSE,BREAK,INPUT and SET CASE as 
;       these have not been fully coded or debugged.  (For next 
;       version of Kermit-80...). Also tidied up a bit.
;
; 13 by OBSchou for Godfrey Nix.  He writes:
;       edit August 11,1986      Godfrey Nix, Nottingham University [gnn]
;       To insert code for setting the packet start character on
;       both send and receive packets (default is still 01H)
;       and make GET and RECEIVE to be separate;
;       use with edits to CP4PKT, CP4UTL
;
; edit 12: 19 June, 1986 by OBSchou.  Added PAUSE and BREAK facility.
;       Breaks simulate a call to sysint which tests for a B being passed.
;       Note this is only useful if the system dependent code supports breaks,
;       and an appropriate message is returned if breaks are not possible.
;       Also added is the command entry for INPUT, which waits for a string
;       from the host for a given time.  The time is a very variable counter
;       incremented every BDOS call.  Trial and error will give a reasonable
;       value.  STRING acceps a string from the use and then sends it on 
;       to the host.  These new commands allow a user to (almost) set up auto
;       log on files, where BREAKS/INPUT/STRING/STRING partially emulate a user
;       (AI LURES OK and all that).  Still could do with a test, eg if not a
;       correctly returned string go back n steps.  This would make a fairly 
;       simple TAKE command a lot more complicated.
;
;edit 11: 30 May, 1986 OBSchou.  Added in a couple of more routines and such
;
;edit 10: 27 May, 1986 OBSchou.  Added in support for USER function
;       removed XMIT test and routine, but also added SET FLOW-CONTROL
;       (set for XON/XOFF flow control in both directions) and a 
;       SET CASE-SENSITIVE ON/OFF (if on => a # A, if ON => a=A)
;
;edit 9: 13 May, 1986 OBSchou, Loughborough University, UK
;       Added in code for SET XMIT character to allow setting of the
;       character to wait for from the host during TRANSMIT.  It is
;       a line feed by default.  Also added a TAKE command, to take: commands
;       from a named disk file.  If a file is TAKEn, then all BDOS calls 
;       are trapped and tested for console input.  If so, we substitute a 
;       character (or buffer) from the TAKE file specified.
;       This may also be used in the future for a CPKERMIT.INI 
;       to be evaluated during Kermit initialsation.
;
; edit 8: February 6, 1895
;       Add a PORT status/show routine for those machines that have more
;       than one they can talk to. It also required a port storage variable
;       a la SPEED and the necessary code to handle it in the SET routine.

;pcc003-pcc005  2-Jan-85        vjc     modules:cp4mit,cp4tt,cp4utl
;       These edits must all be installed together and change the way
;       logging is handled.  The log file spec is moved to a separate
;       fcb, and not opened until an actual CONNECT command is given.
;       This takes care of a NASTY bug that if you used any other file
;       command between the LOG and CONNECT, the log file would get
;       written over the last file used.  This also allows logging to
;       be "permanently" enabled until an CLOSE (new command) for all
;       CONNECT sessions, like most other kermits do.  If a log file
;       already exists, it will be appended to.  Also add two new
;       CONNECT mode commands <esc>Q to suspend logging and <esc>R to
;       resume.  <esc>R means something else during TRANSMIT, but
;       logging is never on then, so there shouldn't be any conflict.
;       I also changed the write code, so that it can handle one more
;       character after the XOFF is send to stop the host.  This allows
;       a little "slop" for systems that don't stop immediately (such
;       as TOPS10), but it didn't help much.
;
;pcc012 4-Jan-85        vjc     modules:cp4mit,cp4tt,cp4utl
;       Use the big buffer for the log file.  Move the log file back
;       into the common fcb and only save the drive, name, and
;       extension between connects.  Add new routines to cp4utl to
;       create or append to an existing file, and to conditionally
;       advance buffers only if in memory.  Remove edit pcc003 that
;       allows one more character after the xoff, since it didn't
;       really work very well and does not fit in well with the way
;       the buffer advancing routines are set up.  If someone still
;       thinks this would be useful, it could be put back in with a
;       little more work.
;       
;       While testing this edit, I also noticed another bug that
;       the command parsing routines do not limit or check the
;       length of command lines or file specs, trashing what ever
;       comes after them.  Currently because of where the fcb and
;       command buffer are located, this does not usually cause a
;       problem, but could if an extremely long line was typed in,
;       or in the future multiple fcbs defined elsewhere in memory
;       were used.  Maybe this should be put on the bug list
;       somewhere.
;
;pcc013 8-Jan-85        vjc     modules:cp4mit,cp4utl,cp4typ
;       Replace CLOSE command to cancel session logging to SET
;       LOGGING ON/OFF.  This seems to fit in with the command
;       structure better.  Default the log file to KERMIT.LOG
;       incase no previous LOG command.  Logging is also enabled
;       by LOG command, as before.
;
; edit 6: September 8, 1984
;       Add VERSION command, to display the internal version strings.
;       Move command tables here from CP4UTL, and translate string
;       lengths in them to decimal (how many fingers do YOU got?).
;       Replace some jump tables with dispatch addresses in tables.
;       Make help text for SET command consistent with top level help text.
;
; edit 5: August 21, 1984
;       Add word at 0100H to allow us to exit cleanly from DDT (shifting
;       entry section by two bytes).
;
; edit 4: August 3, 1984 (CJC)
;       Remove "mover" from entry section, as it now lives in CP4SYS.
;
; edit 3: July 27, 1984 (CJC)
;       Merge LASM support from Toad Hall: most of CP4MIT is now in CP4UTL.
;       When assembling with LASM, CP4MIT is linked by CP4DEF; it links to
;       CP4PKT.  Add SET TACTRAP command.  Separate out display routines so
;       we can eventually do "SHOW <parameter>".  Save both bytes of baud
;       rate in speed, and check both bytes when displaying baud rate.  Move
;       header info to CP4KER.ASM.  Add onoff and chkkey routines to simplify
;       SET command (Toad Hall)
;
; edit 2: June 8, 1984
;       formatting and documentation; delete unreferenced variables and some
;       unnecessary labels; move setpar here from cp4pkt; add module version
;       string; make this version 4.01.
;
; edit 1: May, 1984
;       extracted from CPMBASE.M80 version 3.9; modifications are described
;       in the accompanying .UPD file.

	ORG	100H

; The CCP invokes programs with a CALL 100H, with the stack pointer set to
; 100H.  When we exit to CP/M, we do so with a RET, avoiding a warm boot.
; Unfortunately, DDT starts programs with a jump, not a call, so when we
; attempt to return to CP/M, we blow the stack and use the word at 100H as
; the new PC.  Put a 0 there so we reboot instead of dying horribly.
; (Fortunately, this happens to be two NOP's).
