;       This is the header file for building the system-dependent overlay
;       for KERMIT.  It contains the definitions used to select the target
;       system, and collects (via INCLUDE or LINK directives) the remaining
;       code.  If the target system is one of the supported systems
;       described below, then this is the only file that needs to be
;       edited.

; revision history:
;
;edit 34, 10-Jan-1991 by MF. Put in "terminal required" notation for
;	more machines that need terminals.
;edit 33, 9-Jan-1991 by MF. Put in "terminal required" notation for Access
;	Matrix and eliminated an extra "sysfam set FALSE" when torfam set TRUE
;edit 32, 7-Jan-1991 by MF. Added code by Jay. S. Rouman to support the
;	Ampro Little Board (see CPXBBI.ASM).
;	Also put in a couple of missing .printx's
;edit 31, 2-Nov-1990 by MF.  Moved overlay address to 7000H.
;edit 30, 14-Sep-1990 by MF. Added INCOMPLETE-FILE flag for SET
;	INCOMPLETE-FILE
;edit 29, 11-Sep-1990 by MF.  Moved overlay address for version 4.10.
;	to 6C00H.
; edit 28, 1st September 1990 by Russell Lang, rjl@monu1.cc.monash.edu.au
;	Added support for MicroBee (CPXBEE.ASM).
;
; edit 27, 28-Aug-89 by Mike Freeman, Bonneville Power Administration,
;	P.O. Box 491, Vancouver WA 98666 USA:  add support for Hewlett-
;	Packard HP-125 "Business Assistant" computer using a HP-modified
	;CP/M Version 2.2.
;
; edit 26, 2 December, by OBSchou.  Added code for CP/M-80 Kermit to
;	run on an IBM-PC under Z80MU.  Perverse??  No, its to allow testing
;	of independent code on a PC running CP/M kermit.
;
; edit 25, 27 October, 1987 by OBSchou.  Merged in Sanyo, CompuPro, Genie
;	and TRS Model 4 code, and added four new families.
;	CPXSYO.ASM for the Sanyo, CPXPRO.ASM for the Compupro,
;	CPXTRS.ASM for the TRS-80 Model 4, CPXGNI.ASM for the Genie.
;	Many thanks to G. Smith for these latter two systems.   Also
;	added the WYSE 100 Terminal type to the VDU table.
;
; edit 24, 17 July, 1987 by OBSchou.  Added (hopefully) code from
;	CP/M Kermit 3.5 (WOW) for the Heath 8. (h8quad)  The actual code
;	has been put into the CPXHEA.ASM family file, but I do not actually
;	*KNOW* if this new version works.  Anyone willing to test it out??
;
; edit 23 16 July, 1987 for for Will Rose:
;	edit of 15 Jan 1987 by C W Rose
;	Added code for Micromint SB180 and Ampro 230 terminal.
;
; 	edit of 10 Apr 87 by C W Rose
;	Amended code for pci2651 to handle Telecom Merlin M2215.
;	(8085 at 5 MHz, 2651 USART, port TTY1:, Ampro 230 terminal equivalent).
;	
;	edit of 13 Jul 1987 by C W Rose
;       Added Micromint SB180 with 6/9 MHz. option.
;
; edit 22, 15th July, 1987 by OBSchou for David Moore.  
;	David submitted a paper copy of Kermit 4.05 overlay for a Teletek
;	system:  I have (hopefully) correctly appended his code.  He also
;	send in the code for ADM 22 terminals.
;
; edit 21, 14 July, 1986 by OBSchou for John Shearwood of Birmingham 
;	University.  His edits:
;	edit of Apr 7th, 1987 by JA Shearwood.  Added entry for Cifer Aux port
;	edit of Mar 24 1987 by JA Shearwood, Birmingham.  Added code for Cifer
;	1886 with CP/M Plus
;
;	Also added in code from Chris Miles:
;	edit of 19 May 26, 1987 by C.J.MILES@UMRCC.
;	Kaypro II, Xerox 820 and Big Board II code seperated
;	from CPXSYS.ASM and put in a new family file called
;	CPXBBI.ASM.
;
;	Finally added code from MJ Carter of Nottingham University:
;	edit 16a of 5th Mar 1987 by M J Carter, Nottingham Uni [majoc], to add
;       entry for OEM ScreenTyper (scntpr).  See also CPXFRK.ASM ("fork"),
;       the tail end of CPXLNK.ASM, and the Heath-Zenith family file
;       CPXHEA.ASM (heath, z100, telcon, and scntpr).
;
;	[Note: Martins CPXFRK is another version of CPXSWT.ASM]
;
;
; edit 20, 21 May 1987 by OBSchou for Colin Burns of the Institute 
;	of Neurological Sciences, Glasgow.  Added flag for Hazeltine 1500
;	VDU (h1500)
;
; edit 19, 6th April, 1987 by OBSchou.
;	Added in EQUs for Amstrad 664 and 6128 machines (CPC) and NCR
;	Decsision mate V, bot sets of code submitted by Chris Miles of
;	Manchester University.  NCR code is similar to the PCI2651 code, so
;	NCRDMV chains to CPXTOR.ASM.  CPC cahins to the modified CPXPCW file
;	as submitted by Chris.  *** NOTE *** All Amstrad versions require
;	CP/M 3, so the 664 version must both have the system upgraded to 
;	CP/M 3 and have an aditional RAM pack.  All Amstrad systems require
;	a serial interface.

; edit 18, 30 March, 1986. OBSchou.
;	* * * Here Begineth kermit-80 Version 4.09 * * *
;
;	Biggest change is the overlay address has been moved (again) to 6000h
;	and the files have all been diced into families.  M80 (almost) back 
;	in, though I have found some bugs.  Will worry about those later.
;	CPXSYS.ASM (CP4SYS.ASM in V4.05) now is a family file as well.  
;
;	Comments and all that would be much appreciated.

; edit 17, March 15, by OBSchou to add in support for M80 Macro Assembler.
;       Now its a little messy using the M80 Assembler,asn we have family files
;       and how are we gonna tell M80 what files to use?
;       Sort of Simple: we generate a set of EQUs that only INCLUDE the family
;       file being assembled.  I hope.
;
; edit 16 Dec 1st, 1986 by OBSchou.  Added entry for Amstrad PCW range (PCW)
;	Code in Family file CPXPCW.ASM, submitted by Ian Young of Lattice 
;	Logic Systems.
;
; Edit 15 June 20 1986.  Had to chand org address to 5000h to give room for
;       multi-fcb space for DIR command and other additions in the system
;       indepentent part.  This starts Kermit-80 version 4.08...
;
; Edit 14: March 20, 1986 by OBSchou Loughborough University for 
;       B Robertson, Aberdeen Univ. Computing Centre.
;       Add support for APPLE II with serial cards based on the 6850 ACIA.
;       Mod 380Z support to allow both MDS (5 1/4" discs) and FDS (8" discs)
;       configurations.  Any mistakes on this merge all my fault (OBSchou)
;
; edit 13 22 April, 1986 by OBSchou Loughborough University
;       Changed org address to 4000h to allow for mods to the system
;       independent part for kermit version 4.06
;
; edit 12 5 Febuary, 1986 by OBSchou
;       merged in conditionals for Epson PX8 (px8). Code from Tony Addyman
;       Salford University, England.
;       Added code from other contibutors for Basic Northstar (basicns), 
;       Access-Matrix (access), US Micro Sales s1008 (s1008),
;       Micro Mate (mmate), A.C.E. Discovery (disc).  
;       These I cannot test: please send comments back if these are buggy.
;
; edit 11 29 January 1985 by OBSchou @ multics.lut.ac.uk
;       added in code for 2651 USART for use with CP/M and a VDU

;       Loughborough, Leics, England.
;       Added code for Torch (Second processor to BBC-B) and Cifer 1886
;       Hopefully this code will work with Torchpacks, and Cifer 26xx

;
;pcc001 27-Dec-84       vjc     modules: cp4sys,cp4typ
;       Add conditional for Xerox 820.  I thought at first I could
;       live with the kaypro conditional, but it's enough of a pain
;       that I added it back in.  The clear-to-end-of-screen char
;       is different,  breaking many programs in VT52 mode, and the
;       default escape char control-\, is not at all obvious how
;       to type on the 820 keyboard.  If you muddle through the
;       key translation table, it turns out to be control-comma.
;       Rather than OR xer820 all the occurances of kpII conditionals
;       I added a bbI conditional for all common code for the big
;       board I based machines that is automatically turned on by
;       either kpII or xer820.  This will also make it easier in
;       the future if another flavor of bigboard is added.
;
;pcc010 2-Jan-85        vjc     modules:cp4pkt,cp4typ
;       Control-C during send or recieve clobbers some of the screen
;       and doesn't look nice.  Position the cursor to end of screen
;       before returning to main loop.
;
;pcc013 8-Jan-85        vjc     modules:cp4mit,cp4utl,cp4typ
;       Replace CLOSE command to cancel session logging to SET
;       LOGGING ON/OFF.  This seems to fit in with the command
;       structure better.  Default the log file to KERMIT.LOG
;       incase no previous LOG command.  Logging is also enabled
;       by LOG command, as before.
;
; edit 5: October 13, 1984 by L M Jones, JCC, for New York Botanical Garden
;       Add support for CPT-85xx series of word processors when running CP/M.
;
; edit 4: August 29, 1984 by Bdale Garbee @ CMU
;       Add support for Digicomp Delphi 100 and Netronics Smartvid terminal.
;
; edit 3: July 27, 1984 (CJC)
;       Shuffle files around for easier assembly by both M80 and LASM.
;
; edit 2: June 4, 1984 [Toad Hall]
;       Added Morrow Decision I (the big S100 bus sucker, not the
;       little single motherboard one); added Toad Hall TACTrap to deal
;       with those working through a TAC and its intercept character.
