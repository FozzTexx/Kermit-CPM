This is a copy of Columbia University's Kermit for CP/M. The main change is I created a Makefile to make it easy to cross-assemble using my [LASM compatible assembler](http://www.insentricity.com/a.cl/259/linux-plus-cpm-plus-assembly-equals-lasm). I also added support for the [JAIR 8080 board](http://www.insentricity.com/a.cl/274/kermit-on-the-jair-8080) by adding a few more conditionals to the Heathkit code in cpxhea.asm.
