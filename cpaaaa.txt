Version 4.11 of Kermit-80 is a development of the previous release 4.09,
changed to add more features.  Much of the system-dependent code is as it
was in Version 4.09. The names of the files for Version 4.11 follow a fixed
convention. They all have the form

     CPaxxx.bbb

In these names:

     "a" is one of

          A for general information
          K for documentation and beware files
          S for system independent files
          X for system-dependent source files
          V for system-dependent hex files

     "xxx" is used to identify unique files used

     "bbb" is the file extention, usually one of:

          ASM for source files
          HEX for  pre-assembled modules or completeprograms  (eg 
               LASM.HEX is the assembler)
          HLP for help files
          BWR for beware files
          ANN for notes
          TXT for pure text files
          DOC as for TXT
          MSS SCRIBE sources files (for document files.)

CPKFET.* is a bootstrapping procedure that can be used if you have no other
way to download the new files.

Version 4.11 may be assembled and linked with LASM and MLOAD, respectively,
or it may be assembled with the M80 assembler.

It is also possible to assemble the source files on an IBM PC or clone using
the Z80MU CP/M V2.2 and Z80 emulator, itself running the LASM or M80
assembler.  (Using Z80MU is very useful if your target systems does not have
enough disk space for all the source files.)

CP/M Kermit Version 4.11 is built from the sources in the same manner as was
CP/M Kermit Version 4.09.  LASM and MLOAD may be found in the Kermit
distribution.

The M80 assembler is a Microsoft product, and you have to pay good money for
it.

**Note** The overlay address has been moved to 7000H to make room for the
added code in this version of CP/M Kermit.

Currently, the code for a number of systems has been upgraded from version
4.09.  The particular system is indicated in filenames by the "xxx" part:
codes currently in use are:

APP  Apple II with Z80 card
          - with Micromodem in slot 2
          - with 6551 and 6850 UARTs
          - with CP Multifunction card

BBI  Kaypro, Bigboard, Xerox 820 and Ampro Little Board systems

CIF  Cifer 1886 using the VL:  or AL ports as TTY:Line. (Use &set 
     to  set ttyi:  and ttyo:  to the VL:  or AL:port)  Choice of 
     CP/M V2.2 or 3.0 ("PLUS")

HEA  Heath systms (Heath 8 with quad IO interface board)
     Telcon ZORBA

PCW  Amstrad PCW 8256 and 8152 as well as CP/M-plus on CPC 6128

NOR  Northstar Advantage
     Northstar Horizon (Several: labels in CPXTYP are:
          BASICNS
          NORTHS
          HORIZON
     Comart  Communicator.  This  is included as it  is  somewhat 
     similar to the Northstar Horizon.

TOR  Superbrain  (Main and Aux port versions..  assumes MicroMods 
     add-ons)
     Torch systems (runs ok on Unicorn-5 under CP/M)
     Ithaca Intersystems series machines using the VIO card. (PCI 
     2651 USARTS)
     NCR DecisionMate V systems

as well as another half dozen single system only family files.  The total
list of systems supported so far is:

Any comment, suggestions etc send them in.  I will not guarentee that your
suggestions will be implemented, but maybe....
